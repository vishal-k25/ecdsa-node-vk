# ECDSA Node

ECDSA Node is a software component that implements the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, a popular cryptographic algorithm for creating and verifying digital signatures. This README provides an overview of the ECDSA Node and instructions on how to use it.

## Features

- Generate ECDSA key pairs.
- Sign data with a private key to create digital signatures.
- Verify the authenticity of data using public keys and digital signatures.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with ECDSA Node, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

You can install ECDSA Node via npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install ecdsa-node
